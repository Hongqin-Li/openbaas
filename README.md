## Development workflow

This project is generated by [typescript-starter](https://github.com/bitjson/typescript-starter) initially.

First, we should have `nvm` and `yarn` installed.

- Switch to required node version: `nvm use`
- Install dependencies: `yarn`
- Lint: `yarn fix`
- Test: `yarn test`
- Build: `yarn build`
