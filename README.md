## Development workflow

This project is generated by [typescript-starter](https://github.com/bitjson/typescript-starter) initially.

First, make sure you have `nvm`, `yarn`, `docker`, `kubectl`, `kind` installed.

- Switch to required node version: `nvm use`
- Install dependencies: `yarn`
- Lint: `yarn fix`
- Test: `yarn test`
- Build: `yarn build`

## Known issue

- [Deployment doesn't create new replica set nor give any error](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/36117):
  reinstall kind, see `scripts/init-kind.sh`
