# OpenBaaS

[![CI Status](../../workflows/CI/badge.svg)](../../actions)
[![Deploy Status](../../workflows/Deploy/badge.svg)](../../actions)


> Now moves to [rhymer](https://github.com/Hongqin-Li/rhymer/blob/master/examples/openbaas.rs) as an example, using BaaS library in Rust instead of Parse Server.

Open-source Backend as a Service.

## Development workflow

This project is generated by [typescript-starter](https://github.com/bitjson/typescript-starter) initially.

First, make sure you have `nvm`, `yarn`, `docker`, `kubectl`, `kind` installed.

- Run `sh scripts/initdb-docker.sh` to start mongodb in docker.
- Run `sh scripts/init-kind.sh` to initialize k8s(kind).
- Create another terminal and run `kubectl proxy` so that we can access deployments inside the k8s cluster.

- Switch to required node version: `nvm use`
- Install dependencies: `yarn`
- Lint: `yarn fix`
- Test: `yarn test`
- Build: `yarn build`
- Start Server locally: `yarn serve`

## Known issue

- [Deployment doesn't create new replica set nor give any error](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/36117):
  reinstall kind by `kind delete cluster && sh scripts/init-kind.sh`
